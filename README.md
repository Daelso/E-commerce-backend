## Description:

This project was good practice in combining Express routing with mySQL2/sequelize CRUD functions. I learned a lot of little tricks along the way and got good practice in using the newly learned async format. I previously only had a tenuous grasp over these concepts but now feel much better about my understanding. The program allows for full CRUD functionality of a databse containing 3 tables, categories, products and tags.

## Installation Instructions:

This requires express.js, node.js, mysql2 and sequelize. Open the terminal and begin with ```npm init``` followed by ```npm i``` to hopefully automatically install all required dependencies. If it fails, manually install each with  ```npm i express```, then ```npm i mysql2``` followed by ```npm i sequelize```, and ```npm i dotenv```. You will need to make your own .env file to connect to the DB as one is not included.  As node modules are not included in this repo. This will allow for full functionality.

Run the program by opening your terminal in the main folder and typing ```node index.js```

## Usage:

To dynamically manage a e-commerce backend consisting of categories, products and tags.
